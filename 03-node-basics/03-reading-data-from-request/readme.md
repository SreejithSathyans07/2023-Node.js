## res.on() method
* The on method binds an event to a object.
* It is a way to express your intent if there is something happening (data sent or error in your case), then execute the function added as a parameter. This style of programming is called Event-driven programming. 
* These methods are asynchronous.
* This example is just to demonstrate the row functioning of node.js. Express.js can help us to hide all these complexities with simple and easy to follow implementations.
